# Unit 3: Performance Assessment

Why did you pick this API topic?
I picked this API topic, because I have collected a lot of pokemon data throughout my life, as well as it's probably the only topic that I can do well in 


Describe your API and the available data endpoints
my api allows you to type in a pokemon's name in the url and find battle stats or funfacts about the existing shows.

My endpoints are the following:
/pokemon/:name
/pokemon/shows/:name



How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?
It was great! I had a lot of fun doing so, it exposed me to much cooler aspects of javascript!
